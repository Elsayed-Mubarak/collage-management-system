				<h1>Research Focus</h1>
				<p>The research focus of the Faculty is on
					educational knowledge, activities and institutions that shape
					personal growth, learning and competency development during
					childhood, youth and adulthood.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Educational knowledge</h3>
				<p>refers to interpretations regarding personal growth, learning
					and competency development that justify and serve as the basis for
					educational activity, and the ways in which these can be
					influenced. The Faculty  analysis existing educational
					knowledge and its processes of formation, the content of
					educational knowledge, and the didactic and pedagogic practices of
					learning in a changing social cultural context and produces new
					educational knowledge.</p>
				<h3>Educational activities</h3>
				<p>
					are studied within the structures and practices of policies,
					educational and learning environments, and civic and working life.
					The Faculty research is further profiled by the child, youth
					and adult <span>educational institutions</span> that have been
					created to implement education in society.
				</p>
				<p>Research focusing on the main areas is conducted both at
					regional, national and international levels. Systematic integration
					of approaches within the School and with the universityâ€™s other
					fields of research creates a distinctive educational research
					profile for the University of Tampere.</p>
				<p>The Faculty of Education also conducts speech technique and
					vocology research. The practical speech and voice training
					traditions is combined with multi disciplinary research and thus
					serves the needs of professions within the field of education and
					beyond.</p>
				<h2>Four focus areas of research:</h2>
				<p>The Faculty of Educational research profile is defined
					according to its educational orientation by the following four
					focus areas:</p>
				<h3>1) Increasingly international learning and operating
					environments</h3>
				<p>The increasing internationalisation of education and the
					labour market and the transnational mobility of people result in
					new kinds of learning and operating environments, which overreach
					geographical but also political, social and cultural borders.
					Research on learning and operational environments carried out with
					a subject-didactic perspective is a part of this focus area.

					Research focuses on intercultural interaction and questions of
					learning in different multicultural contexts. The research examines
					formal and informal learning as well as the pedagogic and social
					challenges brought on by internationalisation.</p>
				<h3>2) Educational policies, cultures and structures</h3>
				<p>Research in this focus area examines the discourses,
					operators and institutions of education, as well as their
					interaction. The research focuses on the level of operation from
					the local to the global, and the research subjects could include
					the following:
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>the local adaption of transnational educational policies</li>
					<li>institutional practices within education</li>
					<li>national level decision-making or</li>
					<li>globally outlined discourses of educational policies.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Research is carried out from the perspectives of education
					policy and sociology as well as comparative educational research in
					the context of different countries. The research covers the entire
					field of education from early childhood education to adult
					education.</p>
				<h3>3)Expertise, work and learning</h3>
				<p>The research focuses on professional learning and the
					psychological, social and cultural and historical perspectives of
					vocational learning and multi-professionalism, the development of
					expertise and global networking. The research examines individual,
					collective and organisational change processes related to lifelong
					learning and professional growth in different cultural, historical,
					social and societal contexts. Furthermore, the research is
					interested in the changing field of civic activity. The central
					themes are the changing meanings of equality, participation and
					agency as well as the questions of well-being in the context of
					civic activity and working life. The connections between education,
					the economy and politics as well as culture and nature are
					subjected to critical examination in the research in this focus
					area.</p>
				<h3>4)Curricula research</h3>
				<p>The research in this focus area examines teaching and
					curriculum cultures as well as their changes as a part of the
					operations of communities. The curricula are understood, based on
					the curriculum studies tradition, as target-oriented, dynamic
					processes, which contain historical, cultural and political layers.
					In addition to this, curricula research is a way of understanding
					the daily life of education: what is taught and how. It can also be
					used to examine the development work of education and the operators
					that regulate it. The curricula research targeted at basic and
					upper secondary education is also a part of this focus area. The
					importance of the research is based on the guiding role that
					curricula have in educational policy and increasingly also in the
					education of higher education institutions. At the same time,
					curricula reflect the political and cultural change trends in
					society at the different levels of the educational institution.



					Each research group specialises in at least one target area of
					research, while researchers and teachers are free to participate in
					several groups and work in a range of focus areas. Professors and
					research group leaders are responsible for building mutual
					connections between the focus research areas of the Faculty.
